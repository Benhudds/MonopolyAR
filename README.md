# MonopolyAR
A second year group project augmented reality application developed using Unity and an Android device with the intention of use on a Microsoft HoloLens.

Designed to help the visually impaired by providing large font readable overlays of game board tiles with an optional high contrast mode for colour blind users. Provides a facility to recognise and count game notes adding them to or subtracting them from the balance and keeping a running total. Includes text to speech for game board tiles and balance on the Android platform. Features touch and gaze tracking so the user can touch the screen of an Android device or simply look at a game board tile to construct the information overlay.
